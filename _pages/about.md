I am a third year DPhil Student at the University of Oxford working on optimisation and generalisation in neural networks.
I have studied the connections between Bayesian Neural Networks (e.g. Neural Network Gaussian Processes) and their
optimiser-trained counterparts. Right now, I am looking at feature learning with [Yoonsoo Nam](https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/yoonsoonam).

On the optimisation front, I am working on a more fundamental theory of optimisation, leveraging neural network
architecture bounds, with [Jeremy Bernstein](https://jeremybernste.in).

See the blog posts tab for informal summaries, or check out the Publications tab for the papers.

I like cricket. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KroTWgfz-mA&t=17782s) is a video from our varsity match last year.
